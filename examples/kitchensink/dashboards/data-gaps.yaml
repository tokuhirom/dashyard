          ## Data Gaps Demo
          When a container is redeployed with a new version, the old version stops sending metrics
          and the new version starts shortly after. This creates a gap in the time series where
          no data exists for either version.

          Dashyard detects these gaps and breaks the graph line instead of drawing a misleading
          straight line between the last point of the old version and the first point of the new one.
