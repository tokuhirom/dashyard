          ## Data Gaps Demo
          This graph demonstrates two common deployment scenarios:

          1. **Rolling update (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0):** The new version starts while the old one is still
             running, creating an overlap period where both send metrics. Then the old version is terminated.
          2. **Outage recovery (v1.1.0 → v1.2.0):** v1.1.0 crashes, leaving a period where no version
             is running. After the outage, v1.2.0 is deployed.

          Dashyard detects data gaps and breaks graph lines instead of drawing misleading interpolation.
